# This section explains the concepts of observability 


Observability is the process of understanding the **What, How and Whys** of something. That means the processes and their associated tools enabling one understand the working principle of a thing.

 
## Pillars of Observability
- Metrics
- Logs
- Traces


### Metrics
Numerical measurement of systems and application performance and behaviours. eg. CPU usage, Response Time, Error Rate. They help establish a baseline for what is normal and what is abnormal ðŸ˜‚


### Logs
Logs are records emitted by a system, which could be in a specific format (text, binary, structured or unstructured metadata)


### Traces
There are representation of individual events which could be requests or transactions within a system. They help to identify bottlenecks dependencies and root cause of issues.


The entire pillars of observability is to ensure a system meets it Service Level Objective (SLO) using specified Service Level Indicators (SLI)
